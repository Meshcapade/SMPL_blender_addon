# About
This addon is an extension of the [SMPL-X Blender addon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY2k29Jef94) created by Joachim Tesch and owned by the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems. Meshcapade has licensed the SMPL model and its updates (including SMPL-H, SMPL-X, STAR and SUPR) from Max Planck Institute, and is making this extension of the blender add-on available for commercial users who have an active license for the SMPL Model. 

Academic use of this plugin is free - just contact us at support@meshcapade.com.

This add-on allows you to add [SMPL-H](https://mano.is.tue.mpg.de/), [SMPL-X](https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de), and [SUPR](https://supr.is.tue.mpg.de) bodies to your current Blender scene. Each body consists of a mesh, a shape specific rig, and shape keys (blend shapes) for shape, expression and pose correctives. This addon was most recently developed in Blender 3.5.1.

## Notes

- The add-on GUI (gender, texture, hand pose) does not reflect the state of the currently selected model if you work with multiple models in one scene.
- To maintain editor responsiveness the add-on does not automatically recalculate the corrective pose shape keys when edit the armature pose. Use the `Update Pose Shapes` button to update the joint locations after pose changes.

### Terminal
Opening the terminal window will allow you to see the output of any running script.  It's particularly helpful for displaying progress of lengthier operations, since the UI doesn't show any info.  To achieve this with Linux or Mac, you need to launch Blender from the terminal.  
#### <b>Windows</b>
Click `Window` > `Toggle System Console`
  
![image](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Meshcapade/SMPL_blender_addon/nathan/supr-update-blender/images/windows_terminal_00.png)

#### <b>Mac</b>
- press command + space and type `terminal` and press enter
![image](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Meshcapade/SMPL_blender_addon/nathan/supr-update-blender/images/mac_terminal_00.png)
  
- leave the terminal window open and open up the applications folder in another window
- find Blender, right click on it, and select `Show Package Contents`
- That will open a new folder.  Select `Contents` > `MacOS`
- Inside that folder will be a single file called `Blender`.  Click and drag `Blender` onto the terminal window you opened in the first step.

- Press enter and it will launch blender from the terminal.

#### <b>Linux</b>
This will be slightly different depending on your Linux distribution.
- Open the terminal and go to the location of your blender executable.  
- You can also navigate there in the folder view and then launch the terminal from that location.

- In the terminal, type `blender` and press enter.  This will launch blender from the terminal.
