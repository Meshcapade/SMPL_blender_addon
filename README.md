# About
This addon is an extension of the [SMPL-X Blender addon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY2k29Jef94) created by Joachim Tesch and owned by the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems. Meshcapade has licensed the SMPL model and its updates (including SMPL+H, SMPL-X, STAR and SUPR) from Max Planck Institute, and is making this extension of the blender add-on available for commercial users who have an active license for the SMPL Model.

## Make Addon Release

Run:

```
python build/make_addon.py
```

This wraps all python files and assets in the `meshcapade/meshcapade_addon/data` folder into a zip that can be installed by Blender as an addon.

Be sure to have had Git LFS installed, and pulled, in order to obtain said assets.

## Notes

### SMPL-X

- The add-on GUI (gender, texture, hand pose) does not reflect the state of the currently selected SMPL-X model if you work with multiple models in one scene.
- To maintain editor responsiveness the add-on does not automatically recalculate joint locations when you change the shape manually via Blender shape keys. Use the `Update Joint Locations` button to update the joint locations after manual shape key change.
- To maintain editor responsiveness the add-on does not automatically recalculate the corrective pose shape keys when edit the armature pose. Use the `Update Pose Shapes` button to update the joint locations after pose changes.

### Meshcapade Utilities

- Launching Blender in a terminal will allow one to see the output of any running script. Particularly helpful for displaying progress of lengthier operations, as the UI does not show any info.
