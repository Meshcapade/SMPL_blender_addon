## Notes

### SMPL-X

- The add-on GUI (gender, texture, hand pose) does not reflect the state of the currently selected SMPL-X model if you work with multiple models in one scene.
- To maintain editor responsiveness the add-on does not automatically recalculate the corrective pose shape keys when edit the armature pose. Use the `Update Pose Shapes` button to update the joint locations after pose changes.

### Terminal
- Opening the terminal window will allow you to see the output of any running script.  To achieve this with Linux or Mac, you need to launch Blender from the terminal.  
  - Windows
    - Click `Windows` > `Toggle System Console`

    - leave the terminal window open and open up the applications folder in another window
    - find Blender, right click on it, and select `Show Package Contents`
    - That will open a new folder.  Select `Contents` > `MacOS`
    - Inside that folder will be a single file called `Blender`.  Click and drag `Blender` onto the terminal window you opened in the first step.
